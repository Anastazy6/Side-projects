# Side-projects
This repo contains my side projects: you won't find any The Odin Project stuff here.

### Note:
First and foremost, side projects are meant to be fun for me.
This repo might (and does) include projects that were my first shy attempt to try out
something new (e.g. Alledrogo was my first web scrapping project).
---
My side projects are absolutely free to contain non-English variable names or
unconventional variable name cases (e.g. camelCase instead of snake_case for Python).
This might indicate that a project was written when I was only a step past the absolute
beginner phase (especially the latter issue) or I felt that it was better to break
a convention for a certain purpose (this mostly pertains to non-English variable names).
Or I did it that way just for fun and the feeling of rebelion.
